# SVHN Classification using VGG

## Project Overview

This university course project uses a VGG-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of house numbers from the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset. An interactive demo is also provided using Gradio.

## Installation

Use the provided requirements.txt file to install all necessary libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Lauch Jupyter Notebook `VGG.ipynb`and run each code cell in sequence, following the comments and instructions within the notebook to complete data preprocessing, model training, evaluation and gradio demo interface for real-time handwritten digit classification.# SVHN_Classification_using_VGG
